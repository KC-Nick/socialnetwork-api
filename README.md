# SOCIAL NETWORKING API

## Description
With programming a social networking app, it's important to have social features such as a friends list or ways to interact with posts. In this API, there are several functional endpoints that act to add, edit, and delete users or posts/'thoughts', or add or delete friends or reactions to thoughts. This is a skill important for any full stack or back end developer to master, as many different apps require this kind of API to function fully.

## Features

This project uses models, controllers, and routes with Mongoose and MongoDB to hold a database of documents for users, reactions, thoughts, and friendlists. Using this API one could create a user in the socialnetDB, edit the username of the user account; add friends and delete them; make posts called 'thoughts', edit these, or delete them; react to thoughts or delete the reactions!


## Future Plans

This API was phenomenal practice for creating a database in a new syntax language, as I have had practice with Sequelize before, and it is inspiring to keep working at it to implement a code like this in one of the other projects I have created that could use even more features such as friendslists. This will be useful to try adding other things similar to likes, messages, or anything that could expand this into a highly expansive API for social networking.
